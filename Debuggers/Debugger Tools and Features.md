# Debugger Tools and Features
Debuggers are powerful tools that provide a number of features and tools for analyzing and troubleshooting software and hardware issues.

## Debugger Interfaces
Debuggers can be accessed through a variety of interfaces, including:

- Command-line interfaces: Debuggers with command-line interfaces can be accessed through a terminal or console. These interfaces are often used for scripting and automation.

- Graphical user interfaces (GUIs): Debuggers with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) provide a more intuitive and interactive way to access and control the debugger.

## Debugger Commands and Scripting
Debuggers provide a number of commands and options that allow a developer to control the debugger and access information about the program being debugged. Debuggers also often support scripting, which allows a developer to automate tasks and write scripts to perform complex actions.

## Debugger Extensions and Plugins
Debuggers often provide a way to extend their functionality with plugins and extensions. These extensions can provide additional features or tools that are not part of the core debugger.
