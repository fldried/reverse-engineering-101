# Disassemblers
A disassembler is a tool that translates machine code into human-readable assembly language. This is useful for reverse engineering because it allows us to understand the instructions that are being executed by a program.

There are many different disassemblers available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some disassemblers are designed for specific operating systems or architectures, while others are designed to be cross-platform and cross-architecture.
