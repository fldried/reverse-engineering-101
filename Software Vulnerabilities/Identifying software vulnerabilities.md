# Identifying software vulnerabilities

Identifying software vulnerabilities is an important step in mitigating these weaknesses and protecting against attacks. There are several techniques that can be used to identify software vulnerabilities, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing.
  
(yes we talked about this already(twice))
## Static analysis techniques

Static analysis techniques involve analyzing the source code or binary code of a software system without executing it. These techniques can be used to identify vulnerabilities such as input validation vulnerabilities, resource management vulnerabilities, and cryptographic vulnerabilities. Some common tools used for static analysis include static code analysis tools, decompilers, and disassemblers.

## Dynamic analysis techniques 

Dynamic analysis techniques involve executing a software system and analyzing its behavior during runtime. These techniques can be used to identify vulnerabilities such as authentication vulnerabilities, authorization vulnerabilities, and resource management vulnerabilities. Some common tools used for dynamic analysis include debuggers, profilers, and fuzzers.

## Penetration testing

Penetration testing is a method of evaluating the security of a software system by simulating an attack on the system and attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. Penetration testing can be used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, and can be performed manually or automated using tools such as vulnerability scanners and exploitation frameworks. This is generally related to the "black box" testing method and will often be mentioned as "red teaming" in the context of security.

Here is an example:

`Imagine that a company has developed a new web application and wants to ensure that it is secure before deploying it to production. The company hires a team of penetration testers to evaluate the security of the web application.`

`The penetration testers begin by performing reconnaissance on the web application, gathering information about its features and functionality. They then use this information to identify potential vulnerabilities in the web application, such as weak input validation or insufficient authentication controls.`

`Next, the penetration testers attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities by inputting malicious data or executing malicious code. If the web application is vulnerable to attack, the penetration testers will be able to identify the vulnerability and provide recommendations for how to mitigate it.`

`Finally, the penetration testers report their findings to the company, including a list of identified vulnerabilities and recommendations for how to address them. The company can then use this information to fix the vulnerabilities and improve the security of the web application before deploying it to production.`
