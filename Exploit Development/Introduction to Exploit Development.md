# Introduction to Exploit Development

## What is an Exploit?
An exploit is a piece of code that takes advantage of a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Exploits are often used to gain access to a computer system in order to install malware or to perform other malicious actions. Exploits are also used to gain access to a computer system in order to perform security research or to perform penetration testing.

## Exploit Development
Exploit development is the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in software applications. This involves understanding how software works, identifying vulnerabilities, and creating exploits to take advantage of those vulnerabilities. Some key subtopics can be found in one of the following sections.
