# Introduction to Binary Analysis
## What is binary analysis?
Binary analysis is the process of analyzing and understanding compiled binary code. It is an important technique for reverse engineering, as it allows a developer to understand how a program works and identify potential vulnerabilities and issues.

## Tools and techniques for binary analysis
Tools and techniques for binary analysis include:

- Disassembly: Disassembly is the process of converting machine code into assembly code, which is easier for humans to read and understand.

- Decompilation: Decompilation is the process of converting machine code or assembly code into a high-level programming language, such as C or Python.

- Reverse engineering techniques: Reverse engineering techniques are methods for analyzing and understanding code, such as code review, data flow analysis, and control flow analysis.
