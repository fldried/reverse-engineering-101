# Introduction to Debuggers

A debugger is a tool that is used to analyze and troubleshoot software and hardware issues. Debuggers are commonly used in software development, but they are also used in reverse engineering and other fields.

## Types of Debuggers
There are several different types of debuggers, including:

- Source code debuggers: Source code debuggers allow a developer to analyze and troubleshoot software by stepping through the source code line by line.

- Binary debuggers: Binary debuggers allow a developer to analyze and troubleshoot compiled software by stepping through the machine code instructions.

- Hardware debuggers: Hardware debuggers allow a developer to analyze and troubleshoot hardware issues by accessing and controlling the hardware at a low level.

## Common Use Cases for Debuggers
Debuggers are commonly used in a number of different scenarios, including:

- Troubleshooting software issues: Debuggers can be used to identify and fix bugs in software.

- Reverse engineering: Debuggers can be used to analyze and understand the behavior of software or hardware.

- Exploit development: Debuggers can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in software or hardware.

- Debugging hardware issues: Debuggers can be used to troubleshoot hardware issues by accessing and controlling the hardware at a low level.
