# Using a Debugger

## Setting breakpoints and watchpoints
Breakpoints and watchpoints are two common features of debuggers. Breakpoints allow a developer to pause the execution of a program at a specific point and inspect the state of the program. Watchpoints allow a developer to pause the execution of a program when a specific memory location is accessed or modified.

## Inspecting memory and registers
Debuggers allow a developer to inspect the contents of memory and view the values of variables and registers. This can be useful for understanding the state of a program and troubleshooting issues.

## Disassembling code
Debuggers often include a disassembler, which allows a developer to view the machine code instructions of a program. This can be useful for understanding the behavior of a program at a low level.

## Tracing the execution of a program
Debuggers allow a developer to view the contents of the call stack and trace the execution of a program. This can be useful for understanding the flow of control in a program and identifying issues.
