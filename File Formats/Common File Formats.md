# Common File Formats in Reverse Engineering

## Executable File Formats
Executable file formats are used to store binary data and instructions that can be run on a computer. Some common executable file formats include:

- `.exe` (Windows): The .exe file format is used to store executable files on Windows systems.
- `.dmg` (MacOS): The .dmg file format is used to store disk image files on MacOS systems.
- `.elf` (Linux): The .elf file format is used to store executable files on Linux systems.

## Data File Formats
Data file formats are used to store data that is used by an application or system. Some common data file formats include:

- `.db` (database): The .db file format is used to store database files.
- `.xml` (extensible markup language): The .xml file format is used to store data in a structured format using tags.
- `.ini` (initialization): The .ini file format is used to store configuration data for applications.

## Archive File Formats
Archive file formats are used to package multiple files and directories into a single file. Some common archive file formats include:

- `.zip`: The .zip file format is a widely used archive format that supports lossless data compression.
- `.tar`: The .tar file format is a popular archive format that is used on Unix-like systems.
- `.rar`: The .rar file format is a proprietary archive format that supports lossless data compression.

## Disassembly File Formats
Disassembly file formats are used to store the output of a disassembler, which is a tool that converts binary data into a human-readable assembly language. Some common disassembly file formats include:

- `.asm` (assembly language): The .asm file format is used to store assembly language source
- `.ll` (low-level intermediate representation): The .ll file format is used to store LLVM intermediate representation (IR) source code.
- `.bc` (bitcode): The .bc file format is used to store LLVM bitcode.
- `.obj` (object code): The .obj file format is used to store object code.
- `.lib` (library): The .lib file format is used to store library files.
- `.dll` (dynamic link library): The .dll file format is used to store dynamic link libraries.
- `.so` (shared object): The .so file format is used to store shared objects.
