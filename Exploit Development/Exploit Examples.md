## Exploit Examples
Exploits are a type of attack that take advantage of vulnerabilities in software systems. Here are three common types of exploits:

## Remote Code Execution Exploit
A remote code execution (RCE) exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system. This can be particularly dangerous, as it can allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.

One example of an RCE exploit is the infamous "Shellshock" vulnerability in Bash, a popular command-line shell used in many Unix-based systems. This exploit allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems by injecting malicious commands into environment variables.

## Denial of Service Exploit
A denial of service (DoS) exploit is designed to overload a system with traffic or requests, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as flooding the system with packets or exploiting a vulnerability in the system's network stack.

One example of a DoS exploit is the Ping of Death attack, which takes advantage of a vulnerability in the way some systems handle large ICMP packets. By sending a specially crafted packet that exceeds the maximum packet size, an attacker can cause the target system to crash or become unresponsive.

## Privilege Escalation Exploit
A privilege escalation exploit is designed to allow an attacker to gain higher levels of access to a system than they would normally have. This can be particularly dangerous if the attacker is able to gain administrative or root-level access, as they would then have full control over the system.

One example of a privilege escalation exploit is the "Dirty COW" vulnerability in the Linux kernel. This exploit allowed attackers to gain root-level access to vulnerable systems by exploiting a race condition in the kernel's copy-on-write memory management mechanism.
