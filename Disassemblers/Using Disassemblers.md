# Using Disassemblers
When starting out with reverse engineering, it is important to understand the fundamentals of disassemblers. This will help you to understand how to use disassemblers to reverse engineer programs and applications.

We will go over some of the most important features of disassemblers and discuss how to use them to reverse engineer programs.

## Disassembler Features
There are many different features that can be found in disassemblers. Here are some of the most important ones:

- **Syntax Highlighting**
    Syntax highlighting is a feature that is used to make the disassembly easier to read. It is also used to distinguish between different types of data. For example, instructions are highlighted in one color, registers are highlighted in another color, and so on.
- **Comments**
    Many disassemblers allow you to add comments to the disassembly. This is useful for adding notes about the disassembly and making it easier to understand.
- **Labels**
    Labels are used to give names to addresses in the disassembly. If you are reversing a program that uses a lot of addresses, it can be difficult to remember what each address is used for. Labels can be used to give each address a name that is easier to remember.
- **Search**
    Disassemblers often have a search feature that allows you to search for specific instructions or data in the disassembly. This can be useful for finding specific instructions or data that you are interested in. For example, you can search for a specific function name to find the address of that function.
- **Hex View**
    The hex view is a feature that allows you to view the raw bytes of the disassembly. This can be useful for finding specific bytes in the disassembly.
    Here is an example of the hex view in IDA Pro:

- **Disassembly View**
    This is usually the main view of the disassembler. It shows the disassembly of the program.
- **Graph View**
    In the graph view, the current function is represented as a collection of nodes linked together with edges. Nodes represent basic blocks, and edges represent the flow of control between instructions. This view is useful for understanding the control flow of the program.
- **Strings View**
    The strings view shows all of the strings that are found in the disassembly. This can be useful for finding strings like function names and other important information.
- **Functions, Structurs, Enums View**
    These windows show the functions, structures, and enums that are found in the disassembly. This can be useful for finding important information like function names and data types.

There are many other features that can be found in disassemblers. But we can't cover all of them here.
