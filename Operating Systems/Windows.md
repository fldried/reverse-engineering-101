# Windows
Windows is a popular desktop operating system developed by Microsoft. It is used on a wide range of devices, including personal computers, laptops, tablets, and servers.

## Windows Architecture
Windows is based on a microkernel architecture, in which the kernel and core operating system components are separated from other features and services. This architecture allows for greater modularity and flexibility, but also adds complexity.

## Windows Internals
Windows internals refer to the inner workings of the operating system, including its architecture, components, and processes. Understanding Windows internals is important for reverse engineering, as it can help a developer understand how the system works and identify potential vulnerabilities and issues.

## Windows API
The Windows API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions and tools that allow developers to create applications for the Windows operating system. The Windows API provides access to a wide range of services and resources, including the operating system's user interface, file system, network connectivity, and hardware devices.

## Windows Kernel
The Windows kernel is the central component of the operating system and is responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of the system. The kernel provides a number of services and functions, including memory management, process management, and I/O management.

## Windows Kernel Mode Drivers
Kernel mode drivers are software programs that run in kernel mode and have direct access to the hardware and operating system resources. Kernel mode drivers are typically used for low-level tasks such as device drivers and system services.

## Windows User Mode Drivers
User mode drivers are software programs that run in user mode and have limited access to hardware and operating system resources. User mode drivers are typically used for higher-level tasks such as device-specific functionality and application-specific functionality.

## Windows Services
Windows services are software programs that run in the background and provide a specific set of functions or services. Services can be started automatically when the operating system boots or manually when needed. Examples of services include the print spooler, event log, and Task Scheduler.
