# Static Analysis
Static analysis is the process of analyzing code and data without executing it. It is a useful technique for understanding the structure and functionality of a program, as well as identifying potential vulnerabilities and issues.

## Disassembly and decompilation
Disassembly is the process of converting machine code into assembly code, which is easier for humans to read and understand. Decompilation is the process of converting machine code or assembly code into a high-level programming language, such as C or Python. Both disassembly and decompilation can be useful for static analysis, as they allow a developer to understand the structure and functionality of a program.

## Reverse Engineering Techniques
Reverse engineering techniques are methods for analyzing and understanding code. Some common techniques include:

- Code review: Code review is the process of carefully examining code to understand its functionality and identify potential issues.

- Data flow analysis: Data flow analysis is the process of tracking the flow of data through a program to understand how it is used and modified.

- Control flow analysis: Control flow analysis is the process of tracking the flow of control through a program to understand its logic and functionality.

## Analyzing Code and Data Structures
Analyzing code and data structures is an important part of static analysis. This involves understanding the function and purpose of different code and data structures within a program, as well as identifying potential vulnerabilities and issues.

Some examples of code and data structures that might be analyzed as part of static analysis include:

- Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. Static analysis might involve understanding the input and output of a function, as well as the tasks it performs.

- Data types: Different data types, such as integers, floats, and strings, are used to store different kinds of data. Static analysis might involve understanding how different data types are used and stored within a program.

- Structures and classes: Structures and classes are complex data types that can contain multiple values and functions. Static analysis might involve understanding the structure and function of these data types and how they are used within a program.

- Pointers and references: Pointers and references are data types that store the memory address of other data. Static analysis might involve understanding how pointers and references are used and how they can be manipulated.

- Arrays and lists: Arrays and lists are data structures that store multiple values. Static analysis might involve understanding the structure and function of these data structures and how they are used within a program.

Analyzing code and data structures can involve both understanding the function and purpose of these structures and identifying potential vulnerabilities and issues. For example, an analyst might identify a function that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack, or a data structure that is prone to corruption or exploitation. Understanding the structure and function of code and data structures is an important part of static analysis and can help a developer understand and identify potential issues in a program.
