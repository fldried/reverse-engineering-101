# Exploit Development Tools

Exploit development involves various tools and techniques to find and exploit vulnerabilities. The following are some commonly used tools for exploit development:

## Debuggers

Debuggers are used to identify bugs and vulnerabilities in software by allowing the user to examine and manipulate the code as it runs. Debuggers can be used to step through the code and analyze variables, registers, and memory. They can also be used to set breakpoints and examine the stack.

## Disassemblers

Disassemblers are tools that convert machine code back into assembly language code. This is helpful for analyzing how software works and identifying vulnerabilities. 

## Hex Editors

Hex editors allow users to view and modify binary files. They can be used to analyze the structure of files and identify vulnerabilities. Examples of popular hex editors include Hex Workshop, HxD, and Bless.

## Fuzzers

Fuzzers are tools used to test software by feeding it with a large amount of random or semi-random data in an attempt to cause it to crash or behave in unexpected ways. This can help identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Examples of popular fuzzers include AFL, Peach, and Radamsa.

## Exploit Frameworks

Exploit frameworks are collections of tools and techniques that simplify the process of creating exploits. They typically include pre-written code for various stages of the exploit development process, such as payload creation and delivery. Examples of popular exploit frameworks include Metasploit, CANVAS, Core Impact, and SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit)
