# Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis is the process of analyzing code and data while it is being executed. It is a useful technique for understanding how a program behaves at runtime and identifying potential issues and vulnerabilities.

## Debugging and Tracing
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. Debuggers are tools that allow a developer to execute a program line by line, set breakpoints, and inspect variables and memory. Tracing is the process of recording the execution of a program and analyzing the resulting trace. Tracing tools allow a developer to understand how a program interacts with the operating system and other programs.

## Instrumentation and Monitoring
Instrumentation and monitoring are techniques that allow a developer to insert code into a program to monitor its execution and collect data. This can be useful for understanding how a program behaves at runtime and identifying potential issues and vulnerabilities.

## Fuzzing & Vulnerability testing
Fuzzing is the process of testing a program by providing it with invalid or unexpected input in an attempt to find vulnerabilities. Fuzzing tools can be used to automatically generate and send invalid input to a program in an attempt to cause it to crash or behave unexpectedly. Vulnerability testing is the process of identifying and assessing vulnerabilities in a program. Together, fuzzing and vulnerability testing can be useful techniques for identifying and understanding vulnerabilities in a program.

## Emulation
Emulation is the process of simulating the execution of code on a different platform or environment. Emulation can be useful for dynamic analysis because it allows a developer to test a program in a controlled environment without the need for physical hardware.

## Sandbox analysis
Sandbox analysis is the process of analyzing a program in a sandbox environment. A sandbox is a restricted environment that allows a program to execute without the ability to access sensitive resources or make changes to the system. Sandbox analysis can be useful for understanding how a program behaves in a controlled environment and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Reverse Engineering Techniques
Reverse engineering techniques are methods for analyzing and understanding code and data while it is being executed. Some common techniques include:

- Monitoring system calls: System calls are requests made by a program to the operating system to perform a specific task. Monitoring system calls can be useful for understanding how a program interacts with the operating system and other programs.

- Analyzing network traffic: Network traffic is the flow of data between a program and other devices over a network. Analyzing network traffic can be useful for understanding how a program communicates with other devices and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

- Examining memory: Examining memory can be useful for understanding how a program stores and manipulates data at runtime. Techniques such as memory dumping and memory forensics can be used to analyze the contents of memory and identify potential vulnerabilities.

- Analyzing execution flow: Analyzing the flow of execution of a program can be useful for understanding how it behaves at runtime and identifying potential vulnerabilities. Techniques such as debugging and tracing can be used to understand the flow of execution and identify potential issues.
