# Debugging Techniques
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing issues in software or hardware. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to debug software and hardware issues.

## Debugging with print statements
One of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques is to use print statements to output the values of variables and other information to the console. This can help a developer understand the state of a program and identify issues.

Here is an example of using print statements to debug a C++ program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y) {
    int result = x + y;
    std::cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << result << std::endl;
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Outputs: 3 + 4 = 7
    std::cout << add(3, 4) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Debugging with assertions
Assertions are statements that check for certain conditions in a program and halt execution if the conditions are not met. Assertions can be used to validate the correctness of a program and identify issues.

Here is an example of using assertions to debug a C++ program:
```cpp
#include <cassert>

int add(int x, int y) {
    int result = x + y;
    assert(x > 0 && y > 0 && "x and y must be positive");
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Outputs: Assertion failed: x and y must be positive
    std::cout << add(-3, 4) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Debugging with a debugger
Debuggers are powerful tools that allow a developer to analyze and troubleshoot software and hardware issues. Debuggers provide a number of features, such as breakpoints and watchpoints, that can help a developer identify and fix issues.

Here is the example of using a debugger to debug a C++ program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int x = 3;
    int y = 4;
    int result = x + y;

    std::cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
To debug this program with a debugger, you would first compile it with the `-g` flag to include debugging information using GCC. Then, you would run the debugger and set a breakpoint on the line where `result` is calculated. When the program reaches the breakpoint, you can inspect the values of `x`, `y`, and `result` and step through the program line by line to identify and fix any issues.
