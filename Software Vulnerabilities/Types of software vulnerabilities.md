# Types of software vulnerabilities

Software vulnerabilities come in many different forms, and can exist in various parts of a software system. Understanding the different types of software vulnerabilities is important for identifying and mitigating these weaknesses.

## Input validation vulnerabilities

Input validation vulnerabilities occur when a software system does not adequately validate or sanitize user input, allowing attackers to input malicious data that can be used to exploit the system. These vulnerabilities can lead to attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.

## Authentication vulnerabilities

Authentication vulnerabilities occur when a software system has weak or insufficient authentication controls, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. These vulnerabilities can include weak passwords, lack of multifactor authentication, and failure to properly protect or store authentication credentials.

## Authorization vulnerabilities

Authorization vulnerabilities occur when a software system has weak or insufficient authorization controls, allowing unauthorized users to access restricted resources or perform unauthorized actions. These vulnerabilities can include weak role-based access controls, lack of access controls for sensitive resources, and failure to properly enforce separation of privileges.

## Resource management vulnerabilities

Resource management vulnerabilities occur when a software system fails to properly manage or protect resources, leading to resource exhaustion or denial of service attacks. These vulnerabilities can include failure to properly manage memory, failure to properly release resources, and failure to implement proper rate limiting controls.

## Cryptographic vulnerabilities

Cryptographic vulnerabilities occur when a software system uses weak or insufficient cryptography, allowing attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data. These vulnerabilities can include weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms, improper key management, and failure to properly implement cryptographic controls.
