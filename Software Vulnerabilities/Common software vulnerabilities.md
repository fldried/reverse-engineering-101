# Common software vulnerabilities

## Buffer overflows

A buffer overflow occurs when data is sent to a software system that is larger than the system is able to handle, causing it to crash or allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. This can happen when a program attempts to store more data in a buffer than it is designed to hold, resulting in the data being written to memory locations outside of the buffer. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by overwriting the program's memory with their own code.

## SQL injection

SQL injection occurs when malicious SQL commands are sent to a database through a vulnerable application, allowing attackers to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands. This can happen when user input is not properly sanitized and is passed directly to an SQL database, allowing attackers to send malicious commands that are executed by the database. For example, an attacker might send the following input to a vulnerable application:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```
This input would be passed to the database as an SQL command, allowing the attacker to bypass login controls and access sensitive data.

## Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when malicious code is injected into a web application that is executed by the user's browser, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data or execute arbitrary code. This can happen when user input is not properly sanitized and is displayed on a web page, allowing attackers to inject malicious code that is executed by the user's browser. For example, an attacker might send the following input to a vulnerable application:

```html
<script>alert('XSS attack!')</script>
```
This input would be displayed on the web page, causing an alert box to be displayed to the user.

## Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) occurs when an attacker tricks a user into making an unintended request to a web application, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user. This can happen when a user is authenticated to a web application and an attacker tricks the user into making a request to the application, causing the request to be executed with the user's privileges. For example, an attacker might send a user a link that, when clicked, causes the user's browser to make a request to a web application to transfer money out of the user's account.

## Path traversal

Path traversal occurs when an attacker is able to access files or directories outside of the intended directory structure. This can happen when user input is used to construct file paths, allowing attackers to manipulate the paths to access unintended files or directories. For example, an attacker might send the following input to a vulnerable application:

```html
../etc/passwd
```
This input would cause the application to access the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains a list of system users and their encrypted passwords.

## Vulnerabilities in Anticheats and Games
There are several types of vulnerabilities that can be found in anticheats and games:

1. Memory manipulation vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate the memory of an anticheat or game to achieve unintended results, such as bypassing anticheat checks or altering the game's mechanics.

2. Network manipulation vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate the network communication of an anticheat or game to achieve unintended results, such as bypassing anticheat checks or altering the game's mechanics.

3. Code injection vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject their own code into an anticheat or game, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or modify the game's behavior.

4. Client-side vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities exist in the client-side software of an anticheat or game, allowing attackers to exploit them to achieve unintended results.

5. Server-side vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities exist in the server-side software of an anticheat or game, allowing attackers to exploit them to achieve unintended results.

6. Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system running an anticheat or game.

Here's some examples on recent RCE vulnerabilities in anticheats and games:
- In 2018, a vulnerability in the Roblox game platform was discovered that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the client-side, allowing them to take control of the game and steal sensitive data from players. This vulnerability was caused by a flaw in the way that Roblox handled certain types of data, which allowed attackers to inject their own code into the game.

- In 2020, a vulnerability in the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) game was discovered that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the client-side by sending specially crafted packets to the game's server. This vulnerability was caused by a flaw in the way that the game handled certain types of data, which allowed attackers to inject their own code into the game.

- In 2021, a vulnerability in the EasyAntiCheat (EAC) anticheat software was discovered that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the client-side by sending specially crafted packets to the anticheat's server. This vulnerability was caused by a flaw in the way that the anticheat handled certain types of data, which allowed attackers to inject their own code into the anticheat.

## Other common software vulnerabilities
Other common software vulnerabilities include insecure storage of sensitive data, insecure communication, and insecure input validation.
