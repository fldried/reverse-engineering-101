# Introduction to File Formats

A file format is a standardized way of storing data and instructions in a computer file. There are many different file formats that are used for a variety of purposes, including text documents, images, audio files, and video files.

In reverse engineering, file formats are used to store data and instructions that are extracted from a target system or application. Understanding the structure and content of these file formats is an important part of the reverse engineering process.

There are many different file formats used in reverse engineering which we will take a look into in detail in our next module.

When reverse engineering a file, it is important to identify the file format and understand its structure and content. This can be done using tools such as file signature analysis, file header analysis, and file format documentation.
